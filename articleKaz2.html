                        <p>Beshbarmak (Бешбармак) is a dish enjoyed throughout Central Asia as well as regions of Russia and China. It consists of boiled meat served on a bed of thick, flat noodles and covered in an onion sauce called tuzdyk (туздык). A meal both hearty and delicious, beshbarmak is particularly popular in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan where it holds the privileged position of a national dish. It requires but a few ingredients to prepare, typically feeds an entire party, and, depending on how traditional one wants to be, does not even require eating utensils!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-body ">
                        <h2>How Beshbarmak Got Its Name</h2>
                        <p>The name “бешбармак” is a combination of just two words, “беш” (besh) and “бармак” (barmak) which translate as “five” and “fingers,” respectively. Combined, it describes the traditional way in which the meal is eaten: with the hands. This and the simplicity of “бешбармақ” both speak to the long history of mobile pastoralism practiced throughout the region, lives spent on the move between seasonal grazing grounds, and the people’s dependence upon their animals for sustenance.</p>
                        
                        <p>Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and most other major languages of Central Asia are Turkic in origin. The dish is thus known by similar names across the cultures that traditionally eat the dish. For example, the number five in Kazakh is “бес” (bes) and the meal is sometimes, though not typically, called “бесбармақ”. The “қ” at the end of the word is unique to the Kazakh alphabet. In Uzbek and Kyrgyz, the number five is “беш” and the dish is thus called “бешбармак” (beshbarmak). In the Bashkir and Tatar languages, one would eat “бишбармак” (bishbarmak).</p>
                        
                        <p>Central Asia also occupied a prominent role along the Silk Road. In the Chinese region of Xinjiang, which today boasts a large ethnic Kazakh population, бешбармак is called “нарын” (naryn) in Chinese. Naryn refers to a city, river, and region in Kyrgyzstan. It was also the original name of the food, before “beshbarmak” was first applied to the food during the Soviet era. The new name was originally something of a joke, however, it soon stuck and became the standard. The original, however, naryn, perhaps best reflects the ancient and deep roots that this food has within Central Asian cultures, as it is a name that connects it the food to the wider land and identity of the people.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, while these are the most common names one would encounter on a trip abroad, some traditionalists, particularly in Kazakhstan, will say that beshbarmak is not actually the name of the dish but only the style in which it is intended to be eaten. They instead call it simply
                        “Ет ” (yet) which translates to simply “meat.”</p>

                        <h2>How and When Beshbarmak Is Eaten</h2>

                        <p>While beshbarmak is a delicious meal to eat anytime, most people will tell you that it is difficult to prepare in small portions. Beshbarmak is typically cooked for large gatherings and served family style on platters placed in the center of the table. As a staple of their culture, Central Asians are quite hospitable people and take great pride in their history and traditions. It is not uncommon for guests to be served first with the best cuts of meat though in their absence, this honor is reserved for the eldest in attendance. If you are lucky enough to partake in meal of beshbarmak and find yourself squeamish about using your hands to eat, fret not, utensils are a perfectly acceptable alternative though at least an attempt to eat with your five fingers will surely elicit a great deal of respect from those at the table.

                        <p>For those who find themselves in Kazakhstan without a local chef, beshbarmak can be ordered at restaurants specializing in traditional cuisine.

                        <h2>Preparing Traditional Beshbarmak</h2>

                        <p>Beshbarmak can be prepared in a number of ways depending on the type of meat one would like to include in the dish. The most traditional form of the meal is cooked using horse meat, although beef and lamb are common substitutions. Pork and chicken are not recommended. For those looking to go truly authentic, horse meat sausage called “казы” (kazy) is cooked along with the other cuts.</p>
