<h4><span id="How_<span class="food"><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span>_Got_Its_Name"><strong>How<span class="food"><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span>Got Its Name</strong></h4>
<p><strong>(Почему</strong> <strong>так</strong> <strong>называется</strong><strong>?)</strong></p>
<p>The name “<strong>бешбармак</strong>” is a combination of just two words, “<strong>беш</strong>” (besh) and “<strong>бармак</strong>” (barmak) which translate as “five” and “fingers,” respectively. Combined, it describes the traditional way in which the meal is eaten: with the hands. This and the simplicity of “<strong>бешбармақ</strong>” both speak to the long history of mobile pastoralism practiced throughout the region, lives spent on the move between seasonal grazing grounds, and the people’s dependence upon their animals for sustenance.</p>
<p>Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and most other major languages of Central Asia are Turkic in origin. The dish is thus known by similar names across the cultures that traditionally eat the dish. For example, the number five in Kazakh is “<strong>бес</strong>” (bes) and the meal is sometimes, though not typically, called “<strong>бесбармақ</strong>”. The “<strong>қ</strong>” at the end of the word is unique to the Kazakh alphabet. In Uzbek and Kyrgyz, the number five is “<strong>беш</strong>” and the dish is thus called “<strong>бешбармак</strong>” (<span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span>). In the Bashkir and Tatar languages, one would eat “<strong>бишбармак</strong>” (bishbarmak).</p>
<p>Central Asia also occupied a prominent role along the Silk Road. In the Chinese region of Xinjiang, which today boasts a large ethnic Kazakh population, бешбармак is called “<strong>нарын</strong>” <strong class="food" ></strong> in Chinese. Naryn refers to a city, river, and region in Kyrgyzstan. It was also the original name of the food, before “<span class="food"><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span>” was first applied to the food during the Soviet era. The new name was originally something of a joke, however, it soon stuck and became the standard. The original, however, naryn, perhaps best reflects the ancient and deep roots that this food has within Central Asian cultures, as it is a name that connects it the food to the wider land and identity of the people.</p>
<p>Lastly, while these are the most common names one would encounter on a trip abroad, some traditionalists, particularly in Kazakhstan, will say that <span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span> is not actually the name of the dish but o488&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="<span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span> recipe history culture origin" width="650" height="488" data-lazy-srcset="https://folkways.today/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/<span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span>-1.jpg 1024w, https://folkways.today/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://folkways.today/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/<span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span>-1-768x576.jpg 768w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-lazy-src="https://folkways.today/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/-1.jpg"/>

<p><strong>(Как</strong> <strong>правильно</strong> <strong>есть</strong> <strong>бешбармак?)</strong></p>
<p>While <span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span></h1> is a delicious meal to eat anytime, most people will tell you that it is difficult to prepare in small portions. <span class="food"><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span> is typically cooked for large gatherings and served family style on platters placed in the center of the table. As a staple of their culture, Central Asians are quite hospitable people and take great pride in their history and traditions. It is not uncommon for guests to be served first with the best cuts of meat though in their absence, this honor is reserved for the eldest in attendance. If you are lucky enough to partake in meal of <span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span> and find yourself squeamish about using your hands to eat, fret not, utensils are a perfectly acceptable alternative though at least an attempt to eat with your five fingers will surely elicit a great deal of respect from those at the table.</p>
<p>For those who find themselves in Kazakhstan without a local chef, <span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span></h1> can be ordered at restaurants specializing in traditional cuisine.</p>

<h4><span id="Preparing_Traditional_<span class="food"><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span>"<strong>Preparing Traditional<span class="food"><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span></strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>(Как правильно готовить </strong><strong>бешбармак</strong><strong>?)</strong></p>
<p><span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span></h1> can be prepared in a number of ways depending on the type of meat one would like to include in the dish. The most traditional form of the meal is cooked using horse meat, although beef and lamb are common substitutions. Pork and chicken are not recommended. For those looking to go truly authentic, horse meat sausage called “<strong>казы</strong>” (kazy) is cooked along with the other cuts.</p>
<p>Outside of Central Asia horse meat can be difficult to come by. In fact, some western countries have banned the sale and consumption of horse meat altogether. During the 2012 Olympics in London, the Kazakh national team had to petition the UK government to allow them to bring kazy with them, arguing that it kept them fit and healthy for competition. In addition to beef and lamb, <span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span> in western Kazakhstan, where people have access to the Caspian Sea, is often prepared using fish. Sturgeon is preferred but salmon and trout are also acceptable.</p>
<p>In addition to meat substitutions, the dish can be altered slightly with additional vegetables. Popular choices include carrots and potatoes.</p>
<p>The only other aspect of preparing <span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span> that requires mention here is the noodles. Whether one chooses homemade or store-bought is entirely a personal preference, they should be square or rectangular in shape to allow for easy grabbing – the recipe below calls for diamond shapes. If you happen to be in Kazakhstan’s Kyzylorda region, though, expect to find your <span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span> meat resting upon a bed of rice rather than noodles, a regional variation that exists due to the abundance of that grain in that area. Other regional variations tend to be almost indiscernible to those without deep knowledge of the food. For instance, the difference between Kazakh and Kyrgyz <span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span> is really only that you are more likely to find the onion sauce a bit thicker in Kyrgyzstan than you would in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>However one chooses to prepare <span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span>, the most important thing to keep in mind is to make a lot and invite friends and family with whom to feast. Never fear making too much, either. The largest serving of <span class="food" ><span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span></span>, prepared in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan in 2018, weighed in at just over 3,200 lbs. – and all of it was eaten!</p>

<td valign="top" width="468"><strong>Kazakh <span class="food">Beshbarmak</span></strong>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>• 1.5 kg of meat. (1 kg is approximately 2.2 lbs.)<br/>
• 4 onions<br/>
• Salt<br/>
• Pepper<br/>
• 1 Bay Leaf<br/>
• 600 grams of wheat flour (1 U.S. cup holds approximately 120 grams of wheat flour. Other types of flour may vary).<br/>
• 3 eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Broth</strong></p>
<p>• Wash the meat with cold water, cut it 3-4 roughly equal parts.<br/>
• Place the meat in a large saucepan, pour in cold water (4–4.5 L). Bring to a boil over high heat. When the broth is bubbling, reduce the flame to low and cook for 3-4 hours.<br/>
• Remove foam as it appears. Take out the melted fat with a spoon and pour into a separate container.<br/>
• After 2-3 hours, add salt to the broth, add pepper and bay leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Dough for noodles</strong></p>
<p>• Place flour in a bowl<br/>
• Beat the eggs separately, beat with a fork, as for an omelet, and add to the flour.<br/>
• Add broth little by little and knead the dough with a spoon. When it becomes thick enough (dense), start working with your hands.<br/>
• Cover the dough with plastic wrap and leave for a while.</p>
<p><strong><span class="food">Beshbarmak</span>: the final step</strong></p>
<p>• Remove the meat from the broth. Divide it by the fibers (by hand) into small pieces.<br/>
• Cut the onion not too thick – in half rings. Fry until lightly golden in a skillet using the fat skimmed from the broth. Place the cooked onions on a plate.<br/>
• Roll out the dough very thinly. Cut it into strips 5 cm wide (approximately 2 inches). Divide each into diamonds. Sprinkle them with flour so that they don’t stick together.<br/>
• Take about a liter of broth in a separate saucepan, bring to a boil and boil the dough pieces for one minute.<br/>
• Place the diamonds in the skillet with fat.</p>
<p>Serve <span class="food">Beshbarmak</span> on a shared wide platter or high-sided tray. Put boiled dough down, slices of meat on it, and onion on top. Serve the cooked broth separately. Eat while the <span class="food">Beshbarmak</span> is warm.</p></td>

</tr><tr><td valign="top" width="468"><strong>Ингредиенты</strong>
<ul><li>4 чашки муки</li>
<li>1 яйцо</li>
<li>1 столовая ложка соли</li>
<li>500 грамм ягнятины (или говядины)</li>
<li>2 чайных ложки соли</li>
<li>1 луковица</li>
</ul><p><strong>Приготовление мяса:</strong></p>
<p>Вскипятите воду (5 чашек). Добавьте 2 чайные ложки соли. Порежьте лук тонкими кружками. Добавьте в воду ягнятину и лук и варите мясо в течение двух часов. Через два часа выньте мясо и порежьте его на полоски.</p>
<p><strong>Приготовление лапши:</strong></p>
<p>Смешайте муку с солью. Добавьте яйцо. Добавляйте воду до тех пор, пока образуется единая масса, но не клейкая. Дайте тесту постоять 10 минут, и затем раскатайте его до слоя 6 мм. Порежьте тесто на тонкие полоски (шириной около 6 мм). После того, как мясо приготовлено и удалено из воды, добавьте в воду лапшу. После приготовления мяса в воде, получится мясной бульон, который придаст лапше дополнительный вкус. Кипятите лапшу пять минут. Чтобы сделать вкус блюда еще богаче, вы можете добавить еще несколько кружков лука, и кипятить их с лапшой еще пять минут. Через пять минут выньте лапшу и лук, но оставьте бульон.</p>
<p>Смешайте мясо, лапшу и лук в глубокой тарелке. Добавьте четверть чашки бульона, чтобы придать лапше дополнительный аромат. Блюдо можно подавать на стол. Когда киргизы едят бешбармак, они пьют оставшийся бульон из чайных чашек как прекрасное дополнение к блюду.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="468"><strong>Ingredients</strong>
<ul><li>4 cups of flour</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
<li>1.5 pounds of lamb (or beef)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
</ul><p><strong>Preparing the meat:</strong></p>
<p>Boil 5 cups of water. Add 2 teaspoons salt. Slice the onion into thin circles. Add the lamb and onion to the water and continue to boil the meat for two hours. After two hours, remove the meat and cut into strips.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing the noodles:</strong></p>
<p>Mix the flour with the salt. Add the egg. Stir in warm water until the mixture holds together but is not sticky. Kneed the dough for five minutes. Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes and then roll out the dough until it is ¼ inch thick. Cut the dough into thin strips (about ¼ inch wide). Once the meat has finished cooking, and has been removed from the water, add the noodles. Cooking the meat in the water will create a meaty broth, which will give the noodles extra flavor. Boil the noodles for five minutes. For additional flavor, you can add some more onion slices at this time, letting them boil with the noodles for five minutes. After five minutes, remove the noodles and onions while saving the broth.</p>
<p>Combine the meat, noodles, and onion in a bowl. Pour ¼ cup of the broth on top of the noodles, giving them extra flavor. The dish is now ready to serve. While eating <span class="food" >Beshbarmak</span>, the Kyrgyz drink the remaining broth in tea cups, which complements the dish nicely.</p></td>
