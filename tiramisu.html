    <h1>Deconstructing <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span>: the
        coffee-infused Italian classic</h1>
    <h2>The exact place — and year — of its birth may be hotly disputed, but this creamy, coffee-infused Italian dessert
        has gone on to become a modern classic.</h2>
    <p>
        The author <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Coe">Jonathan Coe</a></span>,
        seeking to add a bit of contemporary colour to his novel <span class="book"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_58_(novel)">Expo 58</a></span>, sends his
        protagonist to a trattoria in <span class="place"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho">Soho</a></span>
        for <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasagna">lasagne</a></span>, <span
            class="drink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chianti">chianti</a></span> and a bowl of creamy,
        coffee-spiked
        <span class="dish"><span class="dish"><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span></span> — a classic Italian dessert
        that was the height of sophistication in postwar
        <span class="place"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"></a>London</span>. The only problem, as <span
            class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Coe">Coe</a></span>
        discovered when he was corrected on the point by a ‘very polite’ Italian
        journalist during an interview, was that the book was set in 1958, and <span class="dish"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span> wasn’t invented until 1959. Or
        perhaps it was the early 1970s. As is so often the case with much-beloved dishes, the origins are as hotly
        disputed as the recipe.

    </p>
    <p>
        According to the Accademia del Tiramisù (an organisation devoted to ‘transmitting the culture of <span
            class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisù</a></span>’), the dessert is a good
        deal older,
        created by a <span class="place"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treviso">Treviso</a></span> madam as an
        aphrodisiac for her clients — ‘a Viagra from the 19th century’, as they put it.
        Although this theory isn’t given much credence by food historians, it may explain why the name translates as
        ‘pick-me-up’ in a local dialect. Prudery over these salacious origins, according to the Accademia, explains why
        the dessert has only started to appear on respectable menus relatively recently.
    </p>
    <p>

        Whether or not this tale has even the lightest cocoa dusting of truth to it pales into insignificance compared
        with the major bone of contention. <span class="place"><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto">Veneto</a></span>, the northeastern region that call <span
            class="place"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice">Venice</a></span>
        its capital, claims it first saw the light of day in the early 1970s at <span class="place">Le Beccherie</span>,
        a restaurant in <span class="place"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treviso">Treviso</a></span>.
        Apparently, it was inspired by a tonic served to pregnant women and nursing
        mothers to build up their strength.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, across the border in <span class="place"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friuli_Venezia_Giulia">Friuli Venezia Giulia</a></span>, a
        mountainous region that borders Austria and Slovenia, they point to a handwritten
        recipe for
        <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span> said to date from 1959
        as evidence they got there first. (There’s another, even earlier version
        produced in the region but it involves whipped cream, rather than mascarpone, so we can safely rule that one out
        of contention.) The author of the <span class="place"><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friuli-Venezia_Giulia">Friuli</a></span> recipe is one <span
            class="person">Norma Pielli</span>, proprietor and chef at the <span class="place">Albergo Roma
            hotel</span> in the Alpine town of <span class="place"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolmezzo">Tolmezzo</a></span>. According to the locals, she served
        the dish, originally dubbed a
        ‘mascarpone slice’, to hungry hikers — one of whom gave it the name it bears to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although <span class="place">Le Beccherie</span> has long been the most widely accepted birthplace of <span
            class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span>,
        following the discovery (and subsequent publication in 2016) of <span class="person">Pielli's</span> recipe, the
        Italian government decided
        that needed to change. In 2017, <span class="person">Norma Pielli</span> was recognised as a <span
            class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodotto_agroalimentare_tradizionale">prodotto
                agroalimentare tradizionale</a></span> (officially
        approved, traditional regional speciality) of<span class="place"><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friuli-Venezia_Giulia">Friuli</a></span>, much to the outrage of the
        Venetians, who’ve threatened legal action to fight the decree. “No one can swindle us
        out of <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span>... the best
        dessert in the world,” <span class="place"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto">Veneto</a></span>
        governor <span class="person"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Zaia">Luca Zaia</a></span>
        declared at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite all this, <span class="place"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto">Veneto</a></span> still
        hosts the annual <span class="event">The Tiramisù World Cup</span> for amateur chefs,
        centred on two categories: ‘original recipe’ and ‘creative recipe’. Entries in the former must use only
        savoiardi (a drier, crumblier version of what we might call ladyfingers or boudoir biscuits), mascarpone, eggs,
        coffee, cocoa powder and sugar, all supplied by the organisers. No alcohol is permitted, because none appears in
        either of the recipes claimed as the original (a detail the <span class="place"><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treviso">Treviso</a></span> camp uses to justify the theory it’s
        based on a dish once served to pregnant women), and this list ‘does not’, the official website insists, ‘admit
        any
        variation’.
    </p>
    <p>
        These six ingredients are one of the few things the two warring regions can agree on, although the richer <span
            class="place">Le Beccherie</span> version uses egg yolks alone, beaten into sweetened mascarpone, while the
        lighter, frothier <span class="place">Albergo Roma</span> dish folds whipped whites into the mascarpone as well.
        That’s where the variation ends, however; both sandwich the creamy mixture with layers of savoiardi soaked in
        coffee, and then finish it all off with a light dusting of cocoa powder. At this point, <span class="dish"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span> is happy to sit
        in the fridge for several hours while the flavours mingle, which may help to explain its popularity with the
        restaurant trade, where anything that can be made ahead of the mad rush of service is a sure-fire winner.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, ‘popular’ may well be an understatement. In 1985, The New York Times devoted an entire half page to the
        ‘newest’ Italian dessert in the city’s restaurants, estimating there were over 200 variations ‘according to one
        authoritative source’. And where <span class="place"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New
                York</a></span> leads, the rest of the <span class="concept"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world">Western world</a></span> follows. Although it’s
        unclear when it first appeared on menus in the <span class="place"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a></span>, it didn’t achieve superstar status
        until the end of the last century, with
        <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigella_Lawson">Nigella Lawson</a></span> dubbing it
        the ‘<span class="dessert"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest_gateau">Black Forest
                gateau</a></span> of the 1990s’ in her 1998 book <span class="book"><a

        <span class="person">Diego Zancani</span>, an emeritus professor of medieval and modern languages at the <span
            class="place"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford">University of Oxford</a></span>,
        whose book, <span class="book">How We Fell in Love with Italian Food</span>, was published this
        year, believes <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span> hit an
        historical sweet spot. “The 1980s were a great period for the expansion of genuine
        <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Italian_dishes">Italian food</a></span>
        abroad,” he tells me. “<span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">Tiramisu</a></span>
        became so iconic because it represented an enhanced, luscious version
        of an Italian classic, the humble gelato — maybe crossed with a <span class="dessert"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest_gateau">Black Forest
                gateau</a></span>. It was a really satisfying,
        versatile pick-me-up that could be eaten as a dessert, but would be an outstanding item at breakfast as well.”
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="person">Diego</span> (who, incidentally, sits in the <span class="place"><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treviso">Treviso</a></span> camp when it comes to <span
            class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span>’s origins) is particularly
        impressed
        by <span class="person"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Locatelli">Giorgio Locatalli</a></span>’s
        spin on the dessert. The Italian chef has developed a lighter
        version involving a mascarpone mousse for his Michelin-starred <span class="place"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"></a>London</span> restaurant <span class="place"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locanda_Locatelli"></a>Locanda Locatelli</span>, because, he
        says, “a real <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span> at the end
        of a meal is a killer — very heavy to digest”. The only exceptions to this rule,
        he adds, are the sort of convivial family gatherings that “take so many hours that at the end you’re feeling
        hungry
        again”.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigella_Lawson">Nigella Lawson</a></span>,
        meanwhile, uses a mixture of coffee and Irish cream in one recipe, and <span class="drink">hazelnut
            liqueur</span> and toasted hazelnuts in another. And at <span class="place">Soho's Chin Chin Dessert
            Club</span>, they’ve turned the dish into an ice cream sundae, complete with an espresso-soaked <span
            class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_brownie">chocolate brownie</a></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even in <span class="place"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a></span> there’s room for a
        little experimentation. <span class="event">The Tiramisù World Cup’s</span>
        ‘creative recipe’ category, which permits the use of three ingredients in addition to mascarpone, eggs, coffee
        and cocoa, was won last year by a fairly straightforward riff involving cinnamon and ginger. But more daring
        entries have included pineapple, matcha tea, chilli and beer, while a controversial vegan version replaced the
        mascarpone custard with rice milk, vegetable cream and potato starch, with handsome-looking results.
    </p>
    <p>
        Such liberties would horrify the <span class="place"><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treviso">Treviso</a></span>-based Confraternità del Tiramisù
        (‘Brotherhood of Tiramisu’), which
        represents 50 members in the Veneto region. It has no truck with the <span class="event">The Tiramisù World
            Cup</span>, or indeed with anyone
        else who tries to muck about with the traditional formula. “We have to protect our identity,” a Brotherhood
        spokesperson told journalists last year. “It is like the <span class="dish"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza">pizza</a></span> that has spread around the world. We have to
        defend it.”
    </p>
    <p>
        You can see their point; a classic <span class="dish"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu">tiramisu</a></span> is a thing of beauty (you can now find
        great versions from <span class="place"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska">Alaska</a></span> to
        <span class="place"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a></span>), but the more people
        who get to enjoy this sweet, creamy dessert, the better — whether it’s the
        original or a whole new interpretation.
