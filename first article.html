<p>A fascinating cuisine, renowned for its use of meat and dairy, these <strong>Kazakh foods</strong> you simply have to try during a visit to Kazakhstan. They are rich in history and offer unique insight into life in this vast, nomadic country.</p>
<p>Its vast grasslands have traditionally been home to nomadic herders, so it&rsquo;s little wonder that traditional Kazakh cuisine relies heavily on the meats and offal of sheep, horses, goats, and occasionally cattle and camels, along with a rich variety of sweet treats, often using variations of milk and dough.</p>



<p>By necessity, this lifestyle has also ensured that Kazakh food is both highly nutritious and can be preserved for long periods of time. The list below is by no means exhaustive but includes many of the timeless Kazakh dishes still popular today.</p>

<p>Traditionally served to new mothers, the sick or the elderly, this hearty grain porridge is made from wheat or millet flour, fried with animal fat to a golden brown, and then simmered in cow&rsquo;s milk and seasoned with sugar and salt.</p>



<p>This staple of Kazakh breakfasts digests easily, and is packed with a host of nutritious ingredients, including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibers, B vitamins, and minerals.</p>



<p>Bylamyk was also one of the go-to meals during the Kazakh famine of the early 20th century.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the famines of yesteryears in Kazakhstan are the main reason this simple and nourishing dish came into existence, and while some argue it&rsquo;s a dish for the young or the elderly, Kazakhs of all ages to this day enjoy Talgan.</p>



<p>Rich and comforting, this is a Kazakh treat to be eaten either in the morning or as a sweet afternoon snack.</p>

This delicious, doughy treat is a favorite in both Kazakhstan, and other countries with Turkic populations.</p>



<p>Baursak is made from a dough of flour and eggs, which is deep-fried, cut into bite-size pieces, and served with sugar, butter, honey or jam. It is often dipped in tea, and it is one of the country&rsquo;s most popular treats.</p>
