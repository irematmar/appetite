                            and origin is that <span class="drink"><a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakı">rakı</a></span> was invented by Turkmen
                            living in <span class="place">Iraq</span>. It is said that from <span

                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakı">rakı</a></span> was spread all around the
                            world and everyone was referring to this drink as “Iraki”, which means “from Iraq”. Like
                            razaki, Iraki is pretty similar to the word <span class="drink"><a

                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakı">rakı</a></span> comes from the Arabic word
                            “arak” which means sweated or sweatdrop or distilled. This is considered as a kind of
                            metaphor about the way that <span class="drink"><a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakı">rakı</a></span> is exposing to
                            distillation in the making process. This word was existing in the 16th century, which is

                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakı">rakı</a></span> may be rooted in a drink
                            that was invented by Sicilians in B.C 9th century. This drink, called tutone, was made by
                            adding anise to alcohol. There is evidence that this drink was produced in the old
                            inscriptions of B.C 1000 in <span class="place">Sicilia</span>. To be more specific, the
                            drink was called “zammu” in those inscriptions, and when added alcohol, it would be called
                            “zambur”. This explains why the drink with anise is called sambuca in <span
                                class="place">Italy</span> today.
