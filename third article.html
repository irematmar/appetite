							KAZAKH FOOD
							
							</h2>
							<p class="actions">
								  Kazakh food is profoundly based on the nomadic past of the Kazakh people. Meat has always been dominating the main meals with mutton and horse together with numerous milk products. The methods of food preparation of the nomadic culture developed essentially in order to secure food preservation. Therefore, there are many dishes based on smoked meat and soured milk. There was almost no possibility to grow vegetables, but it was possible to exchange some things with neighboring settled nations. The main foods in Kazakh cuisine are still based on the combination of meat dough and onion.

When Kazakhs began a more settled way of life, they started to adopt various culinary traditions and enrich their cuisine with the influence of kitchens of those who lived nearby — Russians, Ukrainians, Belarussians, Koreans, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz (very close to Kazakh food culture), Uighurs, Dungans and even Chinese. The result that is a unique blend of food cultures, is today’s Kazakhstan’s national cuisine.
