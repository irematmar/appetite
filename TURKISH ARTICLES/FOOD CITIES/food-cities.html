        </p> 
        <p>
            Throughout history, <span class="place">Anatolia</span> has been a bridge between <span class="place">Asia</span> and <span class="place">Europe</span>. <span class="concept">Anatolian cuisine</span>, which is based on the Turks' roots in <span class="place">Central Asia</span> along with the <span class="concept">imperial cuisines</span> of the Ottoman and Seljuk empires, has picked up aspects from every culture that settled in the region over the centuries. In the end, <span class="concept">Anatolia's gastronomy culture</span> became a melting pot that mesmerizes gourmets with its diversity and rich flavors.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
            When <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastronomy">gastronomy</a></span> is in question, you cannot find a more fitting place than <span class="place">Gaziantep</span>. Located in the southeast of <span class="place">Turkey</span>, <span class="place">Gaziantep</span> is well-known for its long gastronomic history that can be traced back to the Iron Age. To honor the <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span> of <span class="place">Gaziantep</span>, the city was included in <span class="event"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Cities_Network">UNESCO's Creative Cities Network</a></span> in 2015 and since then, the world has been intrigued by its <span class="concept">traditional meals</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="place">Gaziantep</span>'s <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span> mirrors the rich culture and history of the city. Located on the <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road">ancient Silk Road trade route</a></span>, the city has been a hub for merchants from all over the world for centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from its traditional ingredients, the city's <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span> includes mostly meat, vegetables and baked goods from other regions of <span class="place">Turkey</span> brought by immigrants to the region, as well as many foods that originate from our southern neighbor, <span class="place">Syria</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the city is notorious for its mouthwatering meat dishes, pistachios and its legendary desert <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> are the superstars of <span class="place">Gaziantep</span> <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span>.

        <h2 class="food-city"><span class="place">ANTAKYA</span></h2>
        <h3 class="food-city-subheading">For surf and turf fans</h3>
        <p>
            With a coast on the Mediterranean, the southeastern town of <span class="place">Antakya</span> is always a delight to visit. With a history dating back to ancient times and Crusaders, the city offers a layered cultural heritage that is reflected in its <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span>, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than Turkish heritage, the culinary arts of <span class="place">Antakya</span> bear the traces of <span class="concept">Levantine culture</span>. <span class="place">Antalya</span> <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span> offers plenty of meals, where beef and lambs are mainly used.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_arts">culinary arts</a></span> of <span class="place">Antakya</span> offer a bit of every <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity">ethnic group</a></span> that has ever lived or continues to live in the city. While you can find the best examples of <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine">Mediterranean cuisine</a></span> in one restaurant, the next may offer the most delicious <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab">kebab</a></span> you have ever had. If you ever visit <span class="place">Antakya</span>, you should also have a <span class="dish">Turkish breakfast</span>, which is famous for its variety and keeping you full almost all day. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Must-eats: <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh">İçli köfte</a></span>, <span class="place">Antakya</span>-style <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummus">humus</a></span>, <span class="dish">Oruk meatballs</span> and <span class="dish">ekşi aşı soup</span>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="food-city"><span class="place">KONYA</span></h2>
        <h3 class="food-city-subheading">Home of the Mevlevi Order</h3>
        <p>
            Located in the heart of <span class="place">Anatolia</span>, what the <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_arts">culinary arts</a></span> of <span class="place">Konya</span> offer is quite different from the one offered in the southeastern part of the country. <span class="place">Konya</span> is the spiritual capital of <span class="place">Turkey</span>. The city is home to <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi">Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi</a></span>, one of the greatest humanist philosophers and poets of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city, which was once ruled by Greeks, Romans,Byzantines, Seljuks and Ottomans, offers a balanced mixture of a diverse <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span>; however, it is still dominated by the <span class="concept">imperial cuisines</span> of the Seljuks. Despite the <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_cuisine">Ottoman cuisine</a></span>'s heavy reliance on spices, Seljuk <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span> is more abrupt, using the flavors of the main ingredient in as rich and pure a manner as possible. The modesty of the great people who lived in the region has in a way influenced <span class="place">Konya</span> <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span>. Roasted lamb is a prime example. Lean, unmarinated lamb is typically roasted in a tandoori oven in its own juices and fat, owing its flavor only to itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Must-eats: <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etli_ekmek">Meat bread</a></span>, <span class="dish">okra soup</span> and <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirit">tirit</a></span>.

        <h2 class="food-city"><span class="place">TRABZON</span></h2>
        <h3 class="food-city-subheading">A selection of <span class="place">Black Sea</span> <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span></h3>
        <p>
            <span class="place">The Black Sea region of Anatolia</span> distinguishes itself from the rest of the country with its culture and climate as well as its <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_arts">culinary arts</a></span>. As a seaside town, <span class="place">Trabzon</span>'s <span class="concept">famous dish<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span> is mainly dependent on fish. The most <span class="concept"></span> and most important ingredient of <span class="place">Trabzon</span> <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span> is <span class="dish">hamsi</span>, or Turkish anchovies. One can find a variety of dishes featuring <span class="dish">hamsi</span>, sometimes in surprising combinations, including <span class="dish">pickled hamsi</span>. Apart from <span class="dish">hamsi</span>, corn and pastry products are widely used in the city's <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Must-eats: <span class="dish">Fried hamsi</span>, <span class="dish">kale soup</span> and <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuymak">kuymak</a></span>.

        <h2 class="food-city"><span class="place">İZMİR</span></h2>
        <h3 class="food-city-subheading">Capital of Aegean <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span></h3>
        <p>
            To try the Anatolian take on Aegean <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span>, <span class="place">İzmir</span> is the place to go. If you know your history, you might have noticed that all great Greek civilizations were born in <span class="place">İzmir</span> or near it, which makes it rich in culture as well as <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span>. The first Turkish recipe book was written during <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umur_of_Aydın">Umurbey</a></span>'s time in the Aydınoğlu principality that lived in the <span class="place">İzmir</span> before the Ottomans. <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_the_Great">Otto</a></span>, the first king of <span class="place">Greece</span>, also compiled recipes from <span class="place">İzmir</span> and its vicinity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fundamental factor that caused <span class="place">İzmir</span> <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span> to be very rich is the combination of a mild climate and soil composition as well as the migration and trade routes that passed through the region. It is also important to mention that this city is the <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization">cradle of civilization</a></span> and this fact is clearly reflected in the lives of the people that occupied the land throughout the history.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="place">İzmir</span>'s <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span> is rooted in <span class="place">Anatolia</span> itself but was enriched with Aegean and <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine">Mediterranean cuisine</a></span>s. Hosting a large Greek community for centuries, the city adopted the <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine">Mediterranean cuisine</a></span>, so it is not surprising that olive oil is the "miracle drink" for those in <span class="place">İzmir</span>. Olive oil is known to be the source of health, beauty and part of a nutritious diet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The influence of <span class="place">İzmir</span>'s ethnic minorities is reflected in the fish and seafood dishes of the region's <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span>. Aside from a variety of fish dishes, there are also many <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meze">mezes</a></span> made with shrimp, crab, scallops and squid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pastries are also prominent in <span class="place">İzmir</span>'s <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_arts">culinary arts</a></span>, with the queen of every breakfast table in the city being "<span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyoz">boyoz</a></span>", made of flour, sunflower oil and tahini and often filled with ingredients like meat, cheese or spinach. This landmark of a pastry has become part of <span class="place">İzmir</span>'s identity, but it was originally brought to the region by Sephardic Jews in the 15th century.

            Must-eats: <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyoz">Boyoz</a></span>, <span class="dish"></span>kumru, <span class="dish">stuffed zucchini blossoms</span> and <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meze">mezes</a></span>.

        <h2 class="food-city"><span class="place">ADANA</span></h2>
        <h3 class="food-city-subheading">A city that lives and breathes food</h3>
        <p>
            If we could only use one word to describe the <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine">cuisine</a></span> of <span class="place">Adana</span>, it would be "hot." Located in the south of <span class="place">Turkey</span>, <span class="place">Adana</span> is a place like no other. Divided down the middle by <span class="place">Seyhan River</span>, <span class="place">Adana</span> might seem like a serene place but beware. Its locals are known for their quick temper, and the city gets so hot during the summer that by noon the streets are usually completely empty.

The locals like their dish hot and spicy. The city lives for food.
