                Nightingale’s nests, twisted turbans, lover’s lips… In the <span class="place">UK</span>, we may be most familiar with <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> made in a large circular tray and cut into diamond-shaped pieces, but in <span class="place">Turkey</span> this sticky, sweet pastry comes in a whole variety of forms — often with pleasingly poetic names to match. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A syrup-soaked sandwich of tissue-thin yufka pastry and ground nuts, <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> has been the ultimate Turkish festive indulgence for centuries, prepared for all manner of special occasions, from <span class="event">weddings</span> to <span class="event">religious festivals</span>. It’s a descendent of the <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Börek">börek</a></span> and similarly layered, folded — often savoury — yufka pastries, which have been an essential part of <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asian_cuisine">Central Asian Turkic cuisine</a></span> since at least the 11th century. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This culinary <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition">tradition</a></span> is thought to have been combined with the Arab practice of soaking pastries and doughnuts in honey or sugar syrup, resulting in what’s now known as <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span>. And, as the earliest written mention of it by name is in a 15th-century poem — unnamed, as was common at the time — by Turkish <span class="concept">Sufi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dervish">dervish</a></span> <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaygusuz_Abdal">Kaygusuz Abdal</a></span>, we can assume it was already an established dish at this point.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the 16th century, <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> had become a food of renown, and was eulogised by poets in lines such as this, from a verse by <span class="person">Nazmi of <span class="place">Edirne</span></span>: ‘O delightful, delicate, sweet, pleasant <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span>, O jewel, O sultan, of <span class="event"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramazan</a></span> meals.’ Around the same time, <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> makers in palaces and the homes of statesmen across the <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman Empire</a></span> became specialist pastry chefs, comprising a class known as baklavacı.

            <p>
                A kitchen register from <span class="place">Topkapı Palace</span> in 1474 reveals that <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> with 41 layers was made daily during <span class="event"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramadan</a></span> (or <span class="event"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramazan</a></span>, as it’s known in Turkish), and demand was so high the team of baklavacı couldn’t keep up. The task of rolling out the huge numbers of required pastry sheets was therefore outsourced to women working at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> wasn’t just a dish for <span class="event"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramadan</a></span>>, however. It was a feature of grand dinners given by the upper classes throughout the <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman Empire</a></span>. During these multi-course meals, sweet dishes were interspersed with savoury, and diners would eat no more than a morsel of each. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When <span class="person">Lady Agnes Ramsay</span>, wife of the Scottish archaeologist <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Mitchell_Ramsay">Sir William Mitchell Ramsay</a></span>, was invited to a dinner party in the western Turkish town of <span class="place">Şuhut</span>, in the 1890s, she was unfortunately unaware of this practice. When the third course of <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> (filled with clotted cream) arrived, she assumed this marked the end of the meal and ate her fill. In fact, 20 or more courses followed, and with no <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite">appetite</a></span> left she was obliged to continue eating ‘for three long, terrible hours’.
            </p>
            <p>
                Records of <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> outside <span class="place">Istanbul</span> between the 15th and 17th centuries suggest the pastry was spread partly by <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman</a></span> bureaucrats who were posted to provincial towns and cities across the empire, as well as by merchants and other travellers, who are thought to have introduced the dish to countries further afield, from <span class="place">Austria</span> to <span class="place">Iran</span>.

            <p>
                <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">Baklava</a></span> also spread via charity kitchens known as <span class="concept">‘imaret’</span>, which were part of mosque complexes and served meals to staff, visitors and the poor. Copper <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> trays listed in probate registers from the late 15th century onwards reveal that by this point it was no longer a dish exclusive to the elite, but was being made by middle-class families, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for how the dish is prepared, the <span class="concept">traditional Turkish method</span> would involve rolling out yufka (usually made simply with flour and water, although some recipes call for eggs, yoghurt or butter, too) using an oklava: a long, slender rolling pin. This technique involves rolling, flipping and rotating every sheet of pastry multiple times until you’re left with a perfect, paper-thin circle. It requires a great deal of practice and skill, not to mention patience, in order to role out the large amount of pastry that’s required. A simpler method first recorded in the early 19th century — and still widely used today — involves simultaneously rolling out a pile of 10 or more circles of dough. Each of these is dusted liberally with starch to prevent sticking, and a thick rolling pin is used, rather than the traditional oklava.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 17th century, the Turkish explorer and writer <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evliya_Çelebi">Evliya Çelebi</a></span> claimed that <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span>s made for <span class="event">wedding feasts</span> in <span class="place">Belgrade</span> were the size of cartwheels, with every one consisting of 1,000 layers. While there was no doubt of the poetic licence brought into play here, <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman</a></span> recipes do specify up to 60 layers, while insisting the <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> should always remain light. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition">Tradition</a></span> also dictates that the pastry should be so crisp that a coin dropped from a height of an arşın (an old unit of measurement equivalent to about 69cm) should be able to pierce every layer and strike the bottom of the baking tray. From the 17th to the 19th century, this test of excellence was part of guild examinations for young cooks hoping to be promoted to master chef.

In the classic recipe, lemon juice keeps the syrup runny, while in the kuru (‘dry’) version, lemon is omitted so that the syrup crystallises — making the <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> easier to transport. </br>PHOTOGRAPH BY <span class="person">LAURA EDWARDS </span> </figcaption>

            <p>
                The yufka pastry is layered with a filling — usually ground nuts. While almonds or walnuts were originally the most commonly used, hazelnuts, clotted cream, egg custard, fresh cheese, melon and even pureed beans, lentils and chickpeas have also been recorded. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, pistachios and walnuts remain the most popular <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> fillings in <span class="place">Turkey</span>, followed by semolina custard and — more rarely — unsalted fresh cheese. The latter variation, which tends to be eaten hot, as opposed to the more usual room temperature, was once common in <span class="place">Istanbul</span>, but has survived only as a speciality of a few <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_cuisine">regional cuisines</a></span>, notably in the city of <span class="place">Şanlıurfa</span> in southeastern <span class="place">Turkey</span>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Sugar, once an expensive luxury available only to the wealthy, is now much more affordable, and as a result, Turkish <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> is almost universally made with sugar syrup — although in some parts of the country, home cooks use syrups made with honey or grape molasses. Today, the dish is generally baked in the oven, but well into the 19th century it was cooked over a gentle charcoal fire covered by a circular iron griddle, spread with hot embers — a method that’s still employed in some areas.

                While the general concept of <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> is fairly consistent across the former <span class="concept"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman Empire</a></span> and beyond, regional variations abound. In <span class="place">Lebanon</span> less syrup is used, so it’s drier and crunchier. In <span class="place">Algeria</span>, meanwhile, the syrup is typically flavoured with orange blossom water, while in <span class="place">Iran</span> you’ll find it infused with fragrant cardamom and rose water. In <span class="place">Armenia</span>, the nutty filling is spiced with cinnamon and cloves, and in <span class="place">Greece</span> they also favour cinnamon, but tend to use a honey syrup rather than sugar. In <span class="place">Cyprus</span> it’s common to use geranium-infused syrup, with a filling of almonds, cinnamon and rose water. And in <span class="place">Azerbaijan</span> the filling is usually placed between each sheet of pastry, rather than sandwiched in the middle.

                Regardless of where you are, though, <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> is no longer a rarefied indulgence. Particularly in <span class="place">Turkey</span>, you’ll find innumerable shops serving this sweet treat to the masses, as well as plenty of ordinary people making their own at home — even if it’s with shop-bought pastry. It’s still the centrepiece of special occasions, but it’s a dish for every day, too — whether you prefer a twisted turban or lover’s lips.
