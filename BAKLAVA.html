                            itâ€™s known in Turkish), and demand was so high the team of baklavacÄ± couldnâ€™t keep up. The
                            task of rolling out the huge numbers of required pastry sheets was therefore outsourced to
                            women working at home.

                            During these multi-course meals, sweet dishes were interspersed with savoury, and diners
                            would eat no more than a morsel of each.

                                    too.

                            As for how the dish is prepared, the <span class="concept">traditional Turkish method</span>
                            would involve rolling out yufka (usually made simply with flour and water, although some
                            recipes call for eggs, yoghurt or butter, too) using an oklava: a long, slender rolling pin.
                            This technique involves rolling, flipping and rotating every sheet of pastry multiple times
                            until youâ€™re left with a perfect, paper-thin circle. It requires a great deal of practice
                            and skill, not to mention patience, in order to role out the large amount of pastry thatâ€™s
                            required. A simpler method first recorded in the early 19th century â€” and still widely used
                            today â€” involves simultaneously rolling out a pile of 10 or more circles of dough. Each of
                            these is dusted liberally with starch to prevent sticking, and a thick rolling pin is used,
                            rather than the traditional oklava.

                            In the 17th century, the Turkish explorer and writer <span class="person"><a

                            were the size of cartwheels, with every one consisting of 1,000 layers. While there was no
                            doubt of the poetic licence brought into play here, <span class="concept"><a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman</a></span> recipes do
                            specify up to 60 layers, while insisting the <span class="dish"><a

                            also dictates that the pastry should be so crisp that a coin dropped from a height of an
                            arÅŸÄ±n (an old unit of measurement equivalent to about 69cm) should be able to pierce every
                            layer and strike the bottom of the baking tray. From the 17th to the 19th century, this test
                            of excellence was part of guild examinations for young cooks hoping to be promoted to master
                            chef.

                            The yufka pastry is layered with a filling â€” usually ground nuts. While almonds or walnuts
                            were originally the most commonly used, hazelnuts, clotted cream, egg custard, fresh cheese,
                            melon and even pureed beans, lentils and chickpeas have also been recorded.

                        <p>
                            Today, pistachios and walnuts remain the most popular <span class="dish"><a

                            usual room temperature, was once common in <span class="place">Istanbul</span>, but has

                            Sugar, once an expensive luxury available only to the wealthy, is now much more affordable,

                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> is almost
                            universally made with sugar syrup â€” although in some parts of the country, home cooks use
                            syrups made with honey or grape molasses. Today, the dish is generally baked in the oven,
                            but well into the 19th century it was cooked over a gentle charcoal fire covered by a
                            circular iron griddle, spread with hot embers â€” a method thatâ€™s still employed in some
                            areas.

                            While the general concept of <span class="dish"><a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> is fairly consistent

                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman Empire</a></span> and
                            beyond, regional variations abound. In <span class="place">Lebanon</span> less syrup is
                            used, so itâ€™s drier and crunchier. In <span class="place">Algeria</span>, meanwhile, the
                            syrup is typically flavoured with orange blossom water, while in <span
                                class="place">Iran</span> youâ€™ll find it infused with fragrant cardamom and rose water.
                            In <span class="place">Armenia</span>, the nutty filling is spiced with cinnamon and cloves,
                            and in <span class="place">Greece</span> they also favour cinnamon, but tend to use a honey
                            syrup rather than sugar. In <span class="place">Cyprus</span> itâ€™s common to use
                            geranium-infused syrup, with a filling of almonds, cinnamon and rose water. And in <span
                                class="place">Azerbaijan</span> the filling is usually placed between each sheet of
                            pastry, rather than sandwiched in the middle.

                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklava</a></span> is no longer a
                            rarefied indulgence. Particularly in <span class="place">Turkey</span>, youâ€™ll find
                            innumerable shops serving this sweet treat to the masses, as well as plenty of ordinary
                            people making their own at home â€” even if itâ€™s with shop-bought pastry. Itâ€™s still the
                            centrepiece of special occasions, but itâ€™s a dish for every day, too â€” whether you prefer a
                            twisted turban or loverâ€™s lips.
