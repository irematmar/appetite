                        <p class="drop-cap"> Meat has always been dominating the main meals with mutton and horse
                            together with numerous milk products. The methods of food preparation of the nomadic culture
                            developed essentially in order to secure food preservation. Therefore, there are many dishes
                            based on smoked meat and soured milk. There was almost no possibility to grow vegetables,
                            but it was possible to exchange some things with neighboring settled nations. The main foods
                            in Kazakh cuisine are still based on the combination of meat dough and onion.</p>
                        <p>
                            When Kazakhs began a more settled way of life, they started to adopt various culinary
                            traditions and enrich their cuisine with the influence of kitchens of those who lived nearby
                            - Russians, Ukrainians, Belarussians, Koreans, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz (very close to Kazakh food
                            culture), Uighurs, Dungans and even Chinese. The result that is a unique blend of food
                            cultures, is today's <span classs="place">Kazakhstan</span>'s national cuisine.
                        </p>

                        <p>By necessity, this lifestyle has also ensured that Kazakh food is both highly nutritious and
                            can be preserved for long periods of time. The list below is by no means exhaustive but
                            includes many of the timeless Kazakh dishes still popular today.</p>

                        <p>What differentiates the Kazakh cuisine from other Central Asian cuisines are the noodles.
                            There are more varieties of noodles here and they are taken very seriously. It is also not
                            uncommon to have hand made noodles in Kazakh restaurants and especially in the homes of the
                            rural villages.

                            On the other hand, camel is still not as typical for festivities as camels are not as common

                            ingredients, and well as name.
                            For example, the <span class="dish"> Uzbek Lagman</span>, which is also widespread in the
                            border areas with this country, smells quite differently than the <span class="dish"> Uighur

                            <span class="dish"> Uzbek Lagman</span> always looks like soup, while Uighur one can be

                        <p>The name <span class="dish">lagman</span> comes from a modification of the <span
                                class="concept">Dungan</span> word “<span class="dish">lyuman</span>,” which literally
                            means “stretched out dough.” The name is likely even older than that, however, and likely
                            has wide cultural connections. The <span class="concept">Chinese</span>, for instance, have
                            a dish made of wheat noodles called “<span class="dish">lamian</span>” and the <span
                                class="concept">Greeks</span> had a pasta dish called <span
                                class="dish">laganon</span>.” That name lives on in <span class="concept">English</span>
                            as the source of the word <span class="dish">lasagne</span>.” In short, <span
                                class="dish">pasta</span>, as a high-calorie food with a long shelf life, likely spread
                            like wildfire through human populations once it was invented - fast enough that the original
                            name was kept largely intact as it was transferred between cultures and languages.</p>

                        <p>Some in the <span class="place">Middle East</span> consider the dish to have developed in the
                            <span class="concept">Persian Empire</span> and then spread from there. The <span
                                class="concept">Persians</span> called the dish <span class="dish">laksa</span>.” In
                            <span class="concept">Old Persian</span>, this word meant “slippery” and is thought to have
                            referred to the texture of the noodles. The Russian word for “noodles,” incidentally, is
                            “<span class="dish">lapsha</span>”, and is derived from the <span
                                class="concept">Persian</span> term.
                        </p>

                        <p>Proponents of a <span class="concept">Persian</span> origin often point to the map of the
                            <span class="concept">Persian Empire</span> at its height and its rough correspondence to
                            the spread of <span class="dish">lagman</span>. Seafaring <span
                                class="concept">Persian</span> traders also likely introduced the dish to <span
                                class="place">South East Asia</span>, where it took on multiple unique forms, and is to
                            this day widely knwon . This might be explained, but also may have come from nearby Chinese
                            influence. The <span class="concept">Chinese</span> themselves may well have adopted the
                            dish from the <span class="concept">Uighurs</span> or <span
                                class="concept">Dungan(Hui)</span>. The oldest archeological evidence of dumplings,
                            another dough-and-meat dish, has been found in what is now regarded as the <span
                                class="concept">Uighur</span> homeland.

                        <p>Such disputes about ancient artifacts are common, especially with subjects such as food,
                            which can have a large and timeless impact on identity. Culinary historians, however, should
                            be careful to note that while imperial cultures often bequeathed cultural artifacts and
                            traditions to the peoples they conquered, they also absorbed and assimilated culture from
                            those same peoples (and then later bequeathed it to others as their own). A particularly
                            vibrant debate concerning this exists around baklava, for instance.</p>

                        <h2>How and When <span class="dish">Lagman</span> is Eaten: Cultural Significance</h2>
                        <p><span class="dish">Lagman</span>, a simple, filling, and flexible dish, is a staple of diets
                            and commonly eaten across <span class="place">Central Asia</span> and <span
                                class="place">China</span>. Easily made in large quantities, it is also commonly eaten
                            for special occasions and holidays as well.</p>

                        <p>It is sometimes served with the various components (noodles and broth, vegetables, meat,
                            sauces, etc.) in separate bowls, and diners mix and match as they please. However, it is
                            also often served plated with everything assembled - and all ingredients cooked together so
                            that the flavors mix.</p>

                        <p>The methods for eating lagman are as numerous as the ways to prepare it. You can use a fork
                            or chopsticks. Chopsticks are known in most <span class="concept">Turkic</span> and <span
                                class="concept">Slavic</span> as “sticks” - in <span class="concept">Turkic</span>
                            languages, this is some variant of the word “tyakchalar” and in <span
                                class="concept">Slavic</span> languages, it is some variant of “palochki”. The broth is
                            usually drunk straight from the bowl or can be dispensed with a spoon. Although uncommon
                            today, many <span class="concept">Central Asian</span> cultures traditionally ate with their
                            fingers.</p>

                        <p>In its cultural relevance, this simple food is somewhat akin to soup and bread in the West
                            and has many connotations of hospitality, community, and good fortune. One <span
                                class="concept">Asian</span> legend states that the first <span
                                class="dish">lagman</span> was prepared when three traveling merchants met at a
                            crossroads. One had a cauldron, another flour and meat, and the last vegetables and spices.
                            The last man also had culinary and diplomatic skills and suggested that they all pool their
                            resources. Thus, they settled near a spring and the cook/diplomat produced the first <span
                                class="dish">lagman</span>. The legend continues, saying that a <span
                                class="concept">Chinese</span> dignitary passed by, smelled the cooking, asked for some,
                            and, upon eating it, was so amazed that he granted the three travelers a safe and duty-free
                            stay in his territory.</p>

                        <p>The <span class="concept">Chinese</span>, whose culture is steeped in symbolism, also
                            consider <span class="dish">lagman</span> a dish which connotes love, perhaps a connection
                            to previously mentioned story of its origin. Three weary travelers coming together, pooling
                            their resources, and producing a dish that is definitely comfort food par excellence.</p>

                        <p>The best <span class="dish">lagman</span> features homemade, hand-stretched noodles. Of
                            course, today, store-bought noodles are far more common, but making these noodles isn't too
                            hard, even if it requires some patience. Make sure the dough is as elastic as possible by
                            using high quality pasta flour. For each kilogram, you'll need 300 milliliters of water, 2
                            eggs, one teaspoon of vinegar, and salt to taste. Pasta recipes will often skip the vinegar,
                            but it is precisely that which will give your dough the extra plasticity and allow you to
                            stretch it without too much exertion.</p>

                        <p>Pour the flour into a deep bowl, make a well, gently pour in the beaten eggs, and a little
                            warm water. Carefully fold the mixture into dough, and add extra flour to thicken it if need
                            be (but don't add too much or the dough will be too thick to stretch!). Then aggressively
                            knead the dough until it's homogeneous and stretchy. The longer and stronger you knead the
                            dough, the more elastic and adhesive it becomes, making it easier for you to stretch it
                            later. Make the dough into a ball, wrap it in cellophane, and put in a cool place for thirty
                            minutes to an hour to rest.</p>

                        <p>Next, divide the dough into pieces and roll it into thick strands. Carefully coat each strand
                            with vegetable oil and let them sit for 10-15 minutes. After that, start to stretch the
                            dough by rolling it tightly between your palms and the table, trying not to break it. Do
                            this to each strip twice and then stretch it with your hands. The pasta should remain on the
                            table, which makes it easy to roll and keeps it from breaking. If it doesn't turn out like
                            you want, keep trying. Fresh noodles are an unforgettable and tasty experience!</p>

                        <p>Cook the pasta immediately. Fill a deep pot with water, add salt and bring to a boil. Without
                            lowering the heat, put the pasta into the water for 3-5 minutes. Don't stir the pasta,
                            otherwise it will clump. Then, put it into a strainer and rinse with cold water. Put the
                            pasta in a deep dish and coat it with vegetable oil so it won't stick together.</p>

                        <p>If you do use store bought noodles, use regular spaghetti. This has the right texture to eat
                            with a thick dish like <span class="dish">lagman</span>.</p>
